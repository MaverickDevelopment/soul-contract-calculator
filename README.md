## About this app

This app calculates Soul Contract values for any name (person, business, pet, tagline, email, web domain, or otherwise).

A Soul Contract Reading (also known as the Spiritual Numerology of Moses) is an accurate, in depth, channelled system of spiritual interpretations of your birth name. Based on the Kabbalah Tree of Life, it decodes the Spiritual Map of Your Life, so you can align with and manifest your soul purpose. The same principles can be applied to your current name, relationships, business names, address, and much more.
